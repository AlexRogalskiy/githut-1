#### GITHUT 2.0
GitHut 2.0 is an attempt to continue the [githut.info](http://githut.info) project. GitHub is the largest code host in the world, with 40 million users and more than 190 million repositories as of January 2020. By analyzing how languages are used in GitHub it's possible to understand the popularity of programming languages among developers and to discover the unique characteristics of each language. GitHub provides a public [API](//developer.github.com/v3/) to interact with its huge dataset of events and interaction with the hosted repositories. The [GitHub Archive](//githubarchive.org/) project goes one step further by aggregating and storing the API data over time. The quantitative data used in GitHut 2.0 is collected from the GitHub Archive dataset via [Google BigQuery](//developers.google.com/bigquery/).

The language percentage distribution in the line chart shows the top 10 (or manually selected) languages since 2012/Q2. The ranking table shows the top 50 languages of the last quarter. The percentage values are the actual fractions of pull requests, pushes, stars or issues in relation to the top 50 languages in the table. The YoY change shows the difference in percentage compared to the same time period last year. The YoY trend arrows indicate the change in ranking. Two arrows up/down stands for more than three ranks up/down within one year. No arrow indicates that nothing has changed and one arrow fills the gap. Please note that it is possible that the ranking shown in the table does not match the chart ranking, since they are calculated over a different time period (quarter vs. full history). Please also note that there is not enough data available in the GitHub Archive dataset to calculate a statistical accurate ranking table or chart for any time period before 2012/Q2.
