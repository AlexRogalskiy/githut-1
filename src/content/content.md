#### GTHUT 2.0
GitHut 2.0 is an attempt to proceed the [githut.info](http://githut.info) project. The project did not updated since Q4/14, caused by an GitHub API change. Github is the largest code host in the world, with 14 million users and more than 35 million repositories as of April 2016. By analyzing how languages are used in GitHub it is possible to understand the popularity of programming languages among developers and to discover the unique characteristics of each language. GitHub provides a public [API](//developer.github.com/v3/) to interact with its huge dataset of events and interaction with the hosted repositories. [GitHub Archive](//githubarchive.org/) takes this data a step further by aggregating and storing this data for public consumption. The quantitative data used in GitHut 2.0 is collected from the GitHub Archive dataset via  [Google BigQuery](//developers.google.com/bigquery/). These querys are almost the same as SQL queries, with some additional functionality provided by Google. Google provides a free query limit of 1000 GB per month. The query volume is calculated very precise, it only counts the data that you actually access no matter how big the dataset is. That allows you to query datasets even when they are much bigger than the free query volume. The free query limit is therefore sufficient for the purpose of this Website. You will find the queries that are used to calculate the statistics in the Readme.md. However if you don't like the idea of using a Google Service for any reason, you could also download the files from the Github Archive and process them manually. The statistics are updated on a quarterly basis. The language percentage distribution in the line chart shows the top 10 languages since 2012/Q2. The ranking table shows the top 50 langauges based on the last quarter, while the trend is calculated as difference from the same quarter of the year before. The trend arrows indicate the change in ranking. Two up arrows stands for more than three ranks up, compared to the last year. No arrow indicates that nothing has changed, consequently one up arrow fills the gap. The down arrow definition is analogue. Note that it is possible that the ranking shown in the table does not match the chart ranking, since they are calculated over a different time period (quarter vs. full history). Please also note that there is not enough data available in the Github Archive dataset to calculate a statistical accurate ranking table or chart for any time period before 2012/Q2.
