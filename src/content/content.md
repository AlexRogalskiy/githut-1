#### GTHUT 2.0
GitHut 2.0 is an attempt to proceed the [githut.info](http://githut.info) project. The project did not updated since Q4/14, caused by an GitHub API change. Github is the largest code host in the world, with 14 million users and more than 35 million repositories as of April 2016.By analyzing how languages are used in GitHub it is possible to understand the popularity of programming languages among developers and also to discover the unique characteristics of each language. GitHub provides publicly available [API](//developer.github.com/v3/) to interact with its huge dataset of events and interaction with the hosted repositories. [GitHub Archive](//githubarchive.org/) takes this data a step further by aggregating and storing it for public consumption. GitHub Archive dataset is also available via [Google BigQuery](//developers.google.com/bigquery/). The quantitative data used in GitHut 2.0 is collected from GitHub Archive. The data is updated on a quarterly basis. The language percentage
distribution is based on the number of pull requests.
